  This skill diffs and patches — [[sync-api-tools]] handles brand-new gaps.

# Diff and Update Existing MCP Tools Against the Publive Docs

Compares each already-implemented tool's `inputSchema`, handler path, and
description against the live API docs, surfaces every deviation, and — with
user approval — patches the implementation to match.

This is a **manual** workflow — run it on demand, it is not scheduled.

---

## Step 1 — Inventory implemented tools

Read the aggregated tool lists — do not grep for `"name"` strings:

```python
from mcp.cds import TOOLS as CDS_TOOLS
from mcp.cms import CMS_TOOLS
```

Or read `mcp/cds/__init__.py` / `mcp/cms/__init__.py` and each
domain file's `SCHEMAS` list directly. Build a map:

```
tool_name → { file, description, inputSchema, handler_path }
```

Where `handler_path` is the URL path string passed to `cds_client.get` /
`cms_client.*` (or the shared `self.list_resource(path=...)` / `self.get_resource(path_for=...)`
/ `self.create_resource(path=...)` / `self.update_resource(path_for=...)` /
`self.delete_resource(path_for=...)` helpers) inside the handler method.

## Step 2 — Inventory the documented endpoints

Use `publive-docs` MCP tools (`search_publive_docs` /
`query_docs_filesystem_publive_docs`) to tree `/api-reference`:

```
tree /api-reference -L 2
```

For each `.mdx` that maps to an existing tool (skip `README.mdx`, skip
`/api-reference/deprecated/`), read the full file to extract:

- **Method + path** — the HTTP verb and endpoint URL
- **Parameters** — name, type, required/optional, description, constraints
  (min/max, allowed values, default)
- **Response shape** — key fields present in the example response
- **Description / summary** — one-line purpose of the endpoint

Build a parallel map: `doc_endpoint → { method, path, params, description }`.

## Step 3 — Match docs to implemented tools

Use the same naming heuristics from [[add-tool]] to align doc pages to tool
names. If no tool matches a doc page, skip it — that's [[sync-api-tools]]'s
job. Only process endpoints that *do* have a matching tool.

## Step 4 — Diff each matched pair

For every `(tool, doc_endpoint)` pair, compute the delta across four axes:

### 4a — Parameter drift

Compare `inputSchema.properties` against the doc's parameter list:

| Case | Category |
|---|---|
| Tool has a param the doc no longer lists | **Stale param** |
| Doc has a required param the tool marks optional (or omits) | **Missing required param** |
| Doc has an optional param the tool doesn't expose | **Missing optional param** |
| Param type mismatch (e.g. tool says `string`, doc says `integer`) | **Type mismatch** |
| `required` array differs from doc | **Required-flag mismatch** |
| Description materially wrong (not just phrasing) | **Description mismatch** |
| Default or constraint (min/max/enum) differs | **Constraint mismatch** |

### 4b — Handler path drift

Extract the URL string from the handler function (read the source with the
Read tool) and compare it to the doc's `path`. Flag if they differ.
Account for path-template normalisation: `/posts/{id}/` vs `/posts/<id>/`
are the same shape — flag only if the structure differs.

### 4c — HTTP method drift

If the handler calls `cms_client.post` but the doc says `PATCH` (or vice
versa), flag it as a **method mismatch**. Note that the `CmsToolModule`
helpers imply a method: `create_resource` → POST, `update_resource` → PATCH,
`delete_resource` → DELETE.

### 4d — Description drift

Flag only when the tool description is factually wrong (wrong method,
wrong resource, missing a key constraint from the doc). Ignore style
differences — do not rewrite descriptions for phrasing alone.

## Step 5 — Present the diff report

**Do not modify any file yet.** Show the user a structured report grouped
by tool name. For each tool with at least one deviation, list the deltas
as a nested bullet list:

```
fetch_published_posts  (mcp/cds/posts.py)
  - Missing optional param: `tag` (string) — filter by tag slug
  - Constraint mismatch: `limit` max is 100 in docs, tool says 50
  - Stale param: `order_by` — removed from API

create_post  (mcp/cms/posts.py)
  - Missing required param: `canonical_url` (string, required)
  - Description drift: missing note that contributors must exist before creation
```

Then ask the user which changes (if any) to apply. For long lists, show
the full report as plain text first and use `AskUserQuestion` with
`multiSelect: true` (up to 4 options) or ask them to reply with the
tool names or numbers they want patched.

If every implemented tool matches the docs, say so — no need to edit
anything or ask.

## Step 6 — Apply the approved changes

For each tool the user selected, open the domain file with the Read tool,
then apply **only** the specific deltas the user approved (do not
opportunistically clean up anything else):

### Adding / fixing a parameter in `inputSchema`

Use Edit to add or update the property in the `inputSchema` `properties`
dict on the `@tool(...)` decorator and update the `required` array if
needed. Match the doc's type, description, and any constraints (enum,
minimum, maximum, default).

### Removing a stale parameter

Remove the property from `properties` and, if present, from `required`.
Check the handler body — if the stale param was being forwarded to the
API call, remove it there too.

### Fixing a handler path

Edit only the URL string argument in the `cds_client.get` / `cms_client.*`
call, or the `path=` / `path_for=` argument passed to the shared
`list_resource` / `get_resource` / `create_resource` / `update_resource` /
`delete_resource` helper. Do not touch the surrounding logic.

### Fixing an HTTP method

Change `cms_client.post` → `cms_client.patch` (or whatever the doc says), or
switch the shared helper (`create_resource` → `update_resource` etc.). Verify
the dry_run tier is still correct for the new method (PATCH = tier 3 diff,
POST = tier 2 preview).

### Fixing a description

Replace only the `description=` value in the `@tool(...)` decorator. Keep it
within the description rules from [[add-tool]].

## Step 7 — Verify

```bash
python manage.py check

python manage.py shell -c "
from mcp.cds import TOOLS, _HANDLER_REGISTRY as CDS
from mcp.cms import CMS_TOOLS, _HANDLER_REGISTRY as CMS
all_ok = all(t['name'] in CDS for t in TOOLS) and all(t['name'] in CMS for t in CMS_TOOLS)
print('Tools:', len(TOOLS) + len(CMS_TOOLS), '| All handlers present:', all_ok)
"
```

End with a short report:

- **Updated**: tool name + what changed (param added/removed, path fixed, etc.)
- **Skipped by user**: tools they chose not to patch
- **No change needed**: tools that matched the docs exactly
- **Needs a decision**: anything ambiguous (conflicting signals between doc
  and implementation, or where patching would be a breaking change for
  existing callers) — do not touch these without explicit user instruction
